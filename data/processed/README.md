# Processed Data

This folder stores cleaned and transformed datasets created during data preprocessing.

These files are generated automatically from the raw dataset and are used for machine learning modelling.

---

## Contents

Typical processed outputs include:

- cleaned datasets
- feature engineered data
- encoded categorical variables
- scaled numerical features
- modelling-ready datasets

Example file:

```
loan_max_amount_data.csv
```

---

## How Files Are Created

Processed data is produced by running the project notebook:

```
notebooks/Loan Approval Risk and Loan Limit Prediction.ipynb
```

The notebook:

1. Loads raw data  
2. Cleans and transforms features  
3. Applies encoding and scaling  
4. Saves modelling-ready datasets here

## Important Notes

- Files in this folder are reproducible  
- They should not be manually edited  
- If deleted, they can be regenerated by rerunning the notebook  

---

## Folder Purpose

This folder exists to separate:

- raw source data
- transformed modelling data

This reflects standard machine learning project structure.
